The exception is the genres column. As we can see by looking at the column data, movies are associated with multiple genres and separated by a | symbol. Because there can be many different combinations of genres, using the data as it's currently provided won't work for our analysis. Instead, we'll assume the first genre listed is the primary genre for each movie, and during the data cleaning process we'll separate the first genre listed in each row into a new column to use for aswering our question that uses this data. This will reduce the genres to a smaller set of specific genres for us to work with."

    "For movie ratings we learned several things:\n",
    "-\tWhile the Documentary genre received the highest average ratings, it also received some of the fewest votes of any genre. Perhaps movies could be weighted based on their number of votes to get a better sense of genre popularity. \n",
    "-\tLonger movies had better ratings than shorter movies. We can make some assumptions that longer movies likely meant the budget was higher, which could mean that better actors and better equipment was used, but we need more information to make better conclusions. \n",
    "-\tMovies with higher budgets had better ratings than movies with lower budgets. As mentioned in #2, did budget may have affected ratings because a higher budget might also influence movie length, actors hired, equipment, marketing, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For revenue we learned that:\n",
    "-\tCertain months and times of year bring in the most movie revenue. What is it about these time periods that increases the revenue? In Summer months the weather is nicest outside, so why is it so popular for moviegoers? Maybe weather is a factor, because roads are safer? Movies around the holidays are heavily advertised, which may explain some of the popularity there, and it’s also a time of year when families are together, which might result in them wanting to see a movie together.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we drew some conclusions based on our results, our analysis led to more questions that could be answered to better understand what combination of variables have the most influence on the dependent variables of ratings and revenue. "
