The exception is the genres column. As we can see by looking at the column data, movies are associated with multiple genres and separated by a | symbol. Because there can be many different combinations of genres, using the data as it's currently provided won't work for our analysis. Instead, we'll assume the first genre listed is the primary genre for each movie, and during the data cleaning process we'll separate the first genre listed in each row into a new column to use for aswering our question that uses this data. This will reduce the genres to a smaller set of specific genres for us to work with."
