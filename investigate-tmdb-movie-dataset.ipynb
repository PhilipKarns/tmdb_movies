    "In this project we'll be analyzing data associated with movies released between 1960-2015. In particular we'll be interested in finding trends among several variables, including: average rating by movie genre, properties associated with high-revenue movies, whether the month a movie is released has an effect on its revenue, and whether movie length has an affect on ratings.  \n",

Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",
